        <h3>Why we love turtles</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          The basic reason is fairly obvious. Just have a look at those friendly guys! Turtles are pretty awesome. Only a fool would deny that. 
          Yet there's more to it than that. At <span style="font-weight: 700;">West Coast Turtle Club</span> we appreciate turtles not just for their obvious awesomeness.
          More importantly, we recognize in them a source of spiritual wisdom — the kind of wisdom that comes with age.
          Indeed, turtles have been around for some time, and luckily for us they do not plan on leaving any time soon.
          A reassuring thought, to put it mildly, since turtles literally form the backbone of life on earth.
          Those who receive such a claim with scepticism may be interested to learn that this incredible truth was already discovered long ago. 
          The story is as follows.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>An elderly lady once approaches a philosopher to relay her belief that the earth rests on the back of a giant turtle. 
          Politely, the philosopher asked her what was supporting the turtle. 
          "A second, even bigger turtle", she replied in all earnest. 
          "And where does this second turtle find support?" asked the philosopher. 
          To this, the woman cried out jubilantly, "Here I thought you were a clever man! 
          Don't you see — it's turtles all the way down!"</p>
        <br>
        <p>So, there you have it: airtight logic. 
          At <span style="font-weight: 700;">West Coast Turtle Club</span> we say it's about time we start 
          showing some serious reverence to these magnificent creatures reigning supreme!</p>

          <h3>Turtle Baby Crawl (workshop)</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            While nature is full of wonders, the event of turtle hatchlings leaving their nests certainly ranks
            high among them! It's truly phenomenal to see these little rascals emerge from their nests 
            and make their first journey towards the ocean. This summer, <span style="font-weight: 700;">West Coast Turtle Club</span>
            will again host a two-day workshop led by researchers from the California Sea Turtle Conservancy. They will tell us all about the fascinating 
            expedition thousands of baby turtles undertake every year and the perils they face while trying to reach the surf and the deep blue.
